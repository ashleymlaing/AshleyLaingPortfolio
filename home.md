FrontEnd Developer

Ashley Laing

I’m a front-end developer with a passion for JavaScript. I’m exploring my passion for building experiences by learning more programming languages like Java, Swift, C#, and C++. Constant learning is the main driver for my personal goals. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">I&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">have struggled with balancing school, work, and interning at companies like Microsoft, but through it all, I have found myself. The companies that I have worked with have fueled my passion for coding and have strengthened my confidence&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">that software development is the right path for me. I am excited for the future and the opportunities that lie ahead.</span>

I want to work at a company that is innovative, collaborative, and will support my passion for exploring new ideas and learning.
